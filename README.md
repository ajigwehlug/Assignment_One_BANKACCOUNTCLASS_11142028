This program simulates a basic banking system that manages checking and savings accounts.

With this bank account program:
1) Users can create either a checking or savings account with a unique account number and initial balance
2) Add money to an account with validation to prevent invalid amounts
3) Remove money from an account with multiple safety checks including balance verification, withdrawal limit enforcement, and minimum balance protection
4) Automatically calculates and adds earned interest, deducts monthly fees, resets withdrawal counters, and alerts users if their account falls below the minimum balance
5) Move money between two accounts seamlessly, ensuring the withdrawal succeeds before completing the deposit
6) Tracks whether an account is "in the red" (below minimum balance) and monitors the number of withdrawals made each month.
7) Checking and savings accounts have distinct policies regarding interest rates, fees, minimum balances, and withdrawal allowances
The test file demonstrates all these features by creating sample accounts and performing various transactions to verify the system works correctly under different scenarios.
